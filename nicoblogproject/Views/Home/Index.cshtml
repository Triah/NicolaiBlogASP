            Domain name is a blog created by Nicolai Hedegaard Jensen. <br />The main purpose of this blog is to share the knowledge I obtain to help other people, whether that is by finetuning their knowledge or introducing new people to the workd of software development. <br />
            The way I plan to achieve this goal is by writing articles, answering questions and in time offering paid courses on different topics. <br />These can be useful to both the complete beginner and the experienced developer looking to refresh information. <br />
